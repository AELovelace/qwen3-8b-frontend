# image\_alpha

This variable is used to get or to set the alpha value for the sprite. Alpha is always calculated as a value between 0 and 1 where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. Please note that for changes in this variable to be visible, the instance should have either *no* draw event (and so GameMaker will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using one of the extended drawing functions like [draw\_self](../../../Drawing/Sprites_And_Tiles/draw_self.md) or [draw\_sprite\_ext](../../../Drawing/Sprites_And_Tiles/draw_sprite_ext.md).

 

#### Syntax:

image\_alpha

 

#### Returns:

[Real](../../../../GML_Overview/Data_Types.md)

 

#### Example:

image\_alpha \= clamp(image\_alpha \- 0\.01, 0, 1\);

The above code will slowly reduce the image\_alpha until it reaches 0\.
